This installer right now is very hardcoded to build a .bk2 file that can be played back in BizHawk using the gambatte core.  
It is for the german version of pokemon yellow, simply because that is the particular pokemon cart I have laying around.  
To install it on a real cart, you need to use this lua script in BizHawk when playing back the .bk2 to create a .txt file  
that can be played back on a gamecube using gameboy interface:
